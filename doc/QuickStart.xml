This chapter should give you a quick guide to create your first example in &homalg;.

<Section Label="Why ZZ">
<Heading>Why are all examples in this manual over &ZZ; or <M>&ZZ;/m&ZZ;</M>?</Heading>

As the reader might notice, all examples in this manual will be either
over &ZZ; or over one of its residue class rings
<M>&ZZ;/m&ZZ;</M>. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is
that &GAP; does not natively support rings other than &ZZ; in a
<E>sufficient</E> way. We say that a computer algebra system
<Q>sufficiently supports</Q> a ring <M>R</M>, if it contains
procedures to effectively solve one-sided inhomogeneous linear systems
<M>XA=B</M> and <M>AX=B</M> with coefficients over <M>R</M>.

<P/>

The second and more important reason is to underline the fact the all
effective homological constructions has only as much to do with the
Gröbnerbasis algorithm as they do with the Hermite algorithm for the
ring &ZZ;; they are both used to effectively solve inhomogeneous
linear systems over the respective ring. And &homalg; is designed to
use rings and matrices over these rings together with all their
operations as a black box. In other words: Because &homalg; works
for <M>&ZZ;</M>, it works by its design for all other computable rings
(see also <Ref Sect="black box" Text="The black box concept"/>).
