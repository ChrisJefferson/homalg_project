The package &homalg; is meant to be the first volume of a continuously
growing opensource book about
<URL Text="homological algebra">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra</URL>. &homalg; is an
attempt to translate as much as possible of homological algebra, as
can be found in books like <Cite Key="ce"/>, <Cite Key="ML"/>,
<Cite Key="HS"/>, <Cite Key="rot"/>, <Cite Key="weihom"/> and
<Cite Key="GM"/>, into a language that <E>also</E> a computer can
directly understand. And like these books, &homalg; should, to a great
extent, be readable by a mathematician, even without programming
knowledge. For the reasons mentioned below (&see;
<Ref Sect="WhyGAP4"/>) I have chosen &GAP4; as the language of this
project.

<Heading>Why &GAP4;</Heading>

&GAP4; is an object oriented programming language that suits the needs
of mathematical programming more than any other language designed by
computer scientists. This was primarily achieved by the advanced
<URL Text="method selection">
http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/htm/prg/CHAP002.htm</URL>
techniques that very much resembles the mathematical way of thinking.

&GAP4; was developed by mathematicians who needed to handle complex
mathematical structures carrying properties and attributes.

Finally, Chapter <Ref Chap="examples"/>
shows instructive examples for the usage of this package.

The main reference for the Maple implementation is <Cite Key="BR"/>.
