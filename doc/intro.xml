    <Heading>What is the role of the &LocalizeRingForHomalg; package in the &homalg; project?</Heading>

    The &homalg; project <Cite Key="homalg.new"/> aims at providing a general and abstract framework for homological computations. This package enables homalg to extend commutative rings to their localizations at maximal ideals.

  <Section Label="math">
    <Heading>The Math behind this package</Heading>

    The math behind this package is a simple trick in allowing global computation to be done instead of local computations. This works on any commutative computable ring (in the sense of &homalg; <Cite Key="homalg.new"/>) without need of implementign new low level algorithms. Details can be found in the paper <Cite Key="BL"/>.

    <P/>Furthermore we use the package &RingsForHomalg; to communicate with &Singular; and use the implementation of Mora's algorithm there. This is restricted to polynomial rings and needs the package &RingsForHomalg;.
