The package &homalg; is meant to be the first volume of a continuously
growing and opensource book about <URL Text="homological
algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_algebra</URL>. &homalg;
is an attempt to translate as much as possible of homological algebra,
as can be found in books like <Cite Key="ce"/>, <Cite Key="ML"/>,
<Cite Key="HS"/>, <Cite Key="rot"/>, <Cite Key="weihom"/> and
<Cite Key="GM"/>, into a language that <E>also</E> a computer can
directly understand. Yes, ``also'': &homalg; should, as the above
mentioned books, by a great extent be readable by a human being.
Finding such a language was by no means an easy task (&see;
<Ref Sect="FirstSteps"/>). For the reasons mentioned below (&see;
<Ref Sect="WhyGAP4"/>) I have chosen &GAP4; as the language of this
book project.
