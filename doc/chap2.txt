  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [1mpkg[0m directory.
  
  By  default the [1mhomalg[0m package is not automatically loaded by [1mGAP[0m when it is
  installed.  You must load the package with [22m[32mLoadPackage("homalg");[0m before its
  functions become available.
  
  Please,  send  us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.  concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear about applications
  of this package.
