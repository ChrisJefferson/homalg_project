  
  [1X2 Installation of the [5XGauss[1X-Package[0X
  
  To  install  this package just extract the package's archive file to the GAP
  [11Xpkg[0m directory.
  
  By  default  the [5XGauss[0m package is not automatically loaded by [5XGAP[0m when it is
  installed.  You  must load the package with [10XLoadPackage("Gauss");[0m before its
  functions become available.
  
  Please,  send  us an e-mail if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions,
  etc.  concerning this package. Also, I would like to hear about applications
  of this package.
