<Heading>Installation of the &Gauss; Package</Heading>
<Index>&Gauss;</Index>

To install this package just extract the package's archive file to the
GAP <F>pkg/</F> directory. By default the &Gauss; package is not
automatically loaded by &GAP; when it is installed. You must load the
package with <C>LoadPackage("Gauss");</C> before its functions become
available. Please, send me an e-mail if you have any questions,
remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning &Gauss;. Also, I would like to
hear about applications of this package.<Br/>
