    README file for the `SCO' GAP4 package
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download the archive
file
    SCO.tar.gz
and unpack it using 
    gunzip SCO.tar.gz; tar xvf SCO.tar

(Note that if you use a browser like `netscape' for downloading the
archive file the `gunzip' step above may already be done by the browser,
although the name of your file may still have the misleading `.gz'
extension.)

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `SCO'.

This completes the installation of the package.

Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command `gap makedoc.g'
in the SCO directory. But this should not be necessary.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
